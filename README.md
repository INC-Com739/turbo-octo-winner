Create your GitHub repo containing your JS file and a README with instructions to run your program. Upload all your changes to GitHub and share the repo with me!

What i did was:

I created pokemon.js

Used node-fetch dynamically in Node.js to simulate browser fetch.

Made multiple asynchronous requests to the PokéAPI.
- Logged Squirtle's name and base experience.
- Logged Pikachu’s name and types.
- Logged Jigglypuff's name and weight

Extracted and printed specific Pokémon data (name, experience, type, weight, effects, etc.).

Used modern JavaScript features like async/await, arrow functions, optional chaining (?.), and .map().
