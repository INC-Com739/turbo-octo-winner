Practice making requests to the Pokemon API using JS and Node.

## Instructions

1. **Install dependencies** (if using Node.js version < 18):
   ```bash
   npm install node-fetch
   ```
   If you are using Node.js 18 or newer, you can skip this step as `fetch` is built-in.

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   node pokemon.js
   ```

This will log the results of 9 Pokémon API exercises to your console.
